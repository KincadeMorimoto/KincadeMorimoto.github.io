## Feelings on Typescript

I’ve only worked on Python and C++ before, and to be honest, as a not-very-good coder, I find TypeScript an interesting language. Compared to Python, TypeScript feels a bit stricter because of the type system, which sometimes feels frustrating at first but also makes me think more carefully about my code. Compared to C++, it feels much easier and cleaner to write, especially since I don’t have to worry as much about memory management. Even though I’m still learning, I like how TypeScript gives me a safety net with types while still letting me write JavaScript-style code.

## About WODs

I really don’t like being under the pressure of a timer for athletic coding, but I do feel that eventually the timer will help me be able to code under pressure better. Right now, it makes me feel stressed and sometimes I blank out, but I can already see that the repetition is starting to make me more confident with the syntax. I think this style of practice is kind of like doing drills in sports—at first it feels tedious and nerve-wracking, but the more you do it, the more natural it becomes. Even if I don’t enjoy it in the moment, I can see the long-term benefit.

## Overall

Overall, I am liking the way that the class is being structured. The combination of learning concepts, doing WODs, and reflecting on the experience makes me feel more engaged than just sitting through lectures. It feels like I am not just learning a language, but also learning how to become a better problem solver under real-world conditions. I appreciate that the course is pushing me out of my comfort zone, and I think it will pay off as I keep practicing and getting more familiar with TypeScript and software engineering in general.

I had used chatgpt to help structure my thoughts and fix grammar.
