During my 4 years at Mililani High School I participated in the marching band. As the school marching band, we played at football games, pep rallies, parades, and performed at marching band related events/competitions. Being part of this group taught me the importance of discipline, teamwork, and dedication while allowing me to grow as a musician and performer. Especially the performance part, as Mililani focused heavily on our own style of marching band. 

Here is the show I had performed in as a freshman: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDaeoWMg6t0"><i class="large github icon "></i>CIRCUS OF DREAMS | 2018 Mililani HS "Trojan" Marching Band & Color Guard | 2018 Mililani Bandfest</a>
