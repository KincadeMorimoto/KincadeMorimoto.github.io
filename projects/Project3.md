Currently, I am a member of the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa Marching Band. Performing at university football games and community events has given me the chance to collaborate with talented musicians at the collegiate level, while continuing to build leadership, musicianship, and performance experience.

Here is a recent halftime show I performed in: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4y7wa4gnGy8"><i class="large github icon "></i>Halftime vs. Sam Houston September 6, 2025
